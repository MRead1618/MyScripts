#A (much) simpler screenshot. 
#Be sure to do pip install pyscreenshot before running this script

import pyscreenshot as ImageGrab

if __name__ == "__main__":

  im.save("image.png")
  
#TO DO: find a way to send image data through a socket to a remote computer instead of saving it locally
#Remote computer must run a script that will properly save the data
