#A simple command that allows for a range of IPs to be scanned for files/directories using wget

for ip in {1..254}.{1..254}.{1..254}.{1..254}; do wget -t 1 -nc -T 5 $ip/path/file.html; done

#-t = number of tries
#-nc = doesn't overwrite files with the same name in the same directory
#-T = timeout in seconds
